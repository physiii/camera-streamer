/*	Kenneth Lavrsen's mjpeg proxy for Motion: nph-mjprox
 *	This program is published under the GNU Public license
 *  Version 1.0 - 2003 November 19 - Initial Release
 *  Version 1.1 - 2003 November 22 - Greatly improved by Folkert van Heusden
 *    inspired by a suggestion from Torben Jensen
 *  Version 1.2 - 2004 April 02 - Fix for old versions of gcc provided by
 *    Christophe Grenier 
 *  
 *	The program opens a socket to a running Motion webcam server
 *	It then fetches the mjpeg stream from the Motion webcam server
 *	and sends it to standard out (browser).
 *	The idea is that the browser gets the stream from the standard http
 *	port 80 so that company firewalls does not block the stream.
 *	Additionally this program enables the webserver to be on one IP address
 *	and motion running on another IP address and an applet such as
 *	Cambozola will still work because it gets the stream from the webserver.
 *
 *	This program is made as a cgi program for for example an Apache server
 *	It runs as a nph (direct to browser) program. It takes one variable
 *	which is the camera (Motion thread number).
 *	The program must be copied to a directory from which cgi scripts can run.
 *	It must be have access rights set as executable for the web server.
 *	The program must be named with the prefix nph- .
 *	To use it with for example Cambozola add this to an HTML page
 *
 *	<applet code=com.charliemouse.cambozola.Viewer
 *		archive=cambozola6.jar width=325 height=245>
 *		<param name=url value="/cgi-bin/nph-mjprox?1">
 *		<param name="accessories" value="none"/>
 *	</applet> 
 *
 *  Note the number after the "?". This is the camera number (Motion thread no.)
 *
 *	Below the 3 #defines must be set before you build the program.
 *	You need to set IP address of the motion server, the portbase
 *	and the upper limit for the number of cameras you have.
 *	IP address 127.0.0.1 means local host (same machine).
 *	PORTBASE is the number from which the webcam port is calculated.
 *	The calculated port = PORTBASE + Camera Number (thread number).
 *	So if thread 1 has the webcam port set to 8081 the PORTBASE should be 8080
 *	Program can be built with this command:
 *	gcc -Wall -O3 -o nph-mjprox nph-mjprox.c
