/*	Kenneth Lavrsen's jpeg grabber for Motion: nph-mjgrab
 *	This program is published under the GNU Public license
 *  Version 1.0 - 2003 November 19
 *  
 *	The program opens a socket to a running Motion webcam server
 *	It then fetches ONE and only one frame of the mjpeg stream
 *	and sends it to standard out (browser) after having sent a few headers.
 *	It then closes the socket and terminates.
 *	The idea is to show a snapshot of a camera without saving any files
 *	on the web server.
 *	This program is made as a cgi program for e.g. an Apache server.
 *	It runs as a nph (direct to browser) program. It takes one variable
 *	which is the camera (Motion thread number).
 *	The program must be copied to a directory from which cgi scripts can run.
 *	It must be have access rights set as executable for the web server.
 *	The program must be named with the prefix nph- .
 *	The cgi program is run by making an image tag in a HTML file like this:
 *	<IMG SRC = "/cgi-bin/nph-mjgrab?1" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240>
 *  Note the number after the "?". This is the camera number (Motion thread no.)
 *	Below the 3 #defines must be set before you build the program.
 *	You need to set IP address of the motion server, the portbase
 *	and the upper limit for the number of cameras you have.
 *	IP address 127.0.0.1 means local host (same machine).
 *	PORTBASE is the number from which the webcam port is calculated.
 *	The calculated port = PORTBASE + Camera Number (thread number).
 *	So if thread 1 has the webcam port set to 8081 the PORTBASE should be 8080
 *	Program can be built with this command:
 *	gcc -Wall -O3 -o nph-mjgrab nph-mjgrab.c
